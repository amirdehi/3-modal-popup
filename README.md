## Full Description:

A modal popup is a common UI element used for various purposes, such as displaying additional details, forms, or alerts. In this challenge, you'll create a reusable and accessible modal component that dynamically displays content based on the user's action.

Functionality Requirements:

    A button on the page triggers the modal popup.
    The modal should have a close button and also close when clicking outside the modal area.
    It should display dynamic content, which can be passed as text or HTML when opening the modal.

Styling Requirements:

    The modal should appear centered on the screen with a semi-transparent background overlay.
    Ensure that it is responsive and looks good on both desktop and mobile devices.

Accessibility:

    Make sure the modal can be closed using the Escape key.
    Focus should shift to the modal when opened and return to the trigger button when closed.

Advanced (Optional):

    Add smooth animations when the modal appears and disappears.
    Provide a way to pass in customizable titles or styles for the modal.
